# Options -Indexes is a directive used in Apache web server configuration to disable the directory listing feature.
# When this directive is enabled in a directory, the server will no longer display the contents of that directory
# when a client requests a URL that maps to that directory.
# Instead, the server will return an error message indicating that the directory listing is not available.
# This directive is commonly used to prevent unauthorized access to the contents of a directory,
# as it stops anyone from being able to browse the contents of the directory through a web browser.
